<!--
### How it works

**TODO: Describe how it works**
-->

## Set up

### Requirements

- [Java Development Kit](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) version 11 or later.
- A Twilio account - [sign up](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)

### Twilio Account Settings

This application should give you a ready-made starting point for writing your
own appointment reminder application. Before we begin, we need to collect
all the config values we need to run the application:

| Config&nbsp;Value | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account&nbsp;Sid  | Your primary Twilio account identifier - find this [in the Console](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Auth&nbsp;Token   | Used to authenticate - [just like the above, you'll find this here](https://www.twilio.com/console).                                                         |
| Verification&nbsp;Sid |  For Verification Service SID. You can generate one [here](https://www.twilio.com/console/verify/services) |

### Local development

After the above requirements have been met:

1. Clone this repository and `cd` into it

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:TwilioDevEd/verify-v2-quickstart-java.git
    cd verify-v2-quickstart-java
    ```

2. Set your environment variables

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    See [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings) to locate the necessary environment variables.

3. Build the project

    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    **NOTE:** Running the build task will also run the tests

4. Run the application

    ```bash
    make serve
    ```
    **NOTE:** If you are using a dedicated Java IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ, you can start the application within the IDE and it will start in development mode, which means any changes on a source file will be automatically reloaded.

5. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

That's it!

### Docker

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) already installed on your machine, you can use our `docker-compose.yml` to setup your project.

1. Make sure you have the project cloned.
2. Setup the environmental variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file, see the [Twilio Account Settings](#twilio-account-settings).
3. Run `docker-compose --env-file /dev/null up`.

### Tests

You can run the tests locally by typing:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Cloud deployment

Additionally to trying out this application locally, you can deploy it to a variety of host services. Here is a small selection of them.

Please be aware that some of these might charge you for the usage or might make the source code for this application visible to the public. When in doubt research the respective hosting service first.

| Service                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) | [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/verify-v2-quickstart-java/tree/master)                                                                                                                                       |

**Some notes:** 
- For Heroku, please [check this](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-gradle-apps-on-heroku) to properly configure the project for deployment.
- You can also follow [this guide](https://vaadin.com/blog/how-to-deploy-your-java-app-to-the-cloud) to deploy the application to several other cloud services including Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, etc.
